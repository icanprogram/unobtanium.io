title: "Technical details and advantages of the Unobtanium network"

Unobtanium was not pre-mined, there were no bounties, and the lead developer on our project returned to us with only 4 UNOs in his wallet. This type of dedication and purity with regards to open-source fundementals touched me in a very deep and profound way. It inspired me to create a new revolution in open-source development. Instead of keeping my holdings to myself, I have distributed my personal shares to the development team. This means that not only am I commited to the success of Unobtanium, but the development team shares an equally deep interest in creating valuable services for our emerging customer base.

## Benefits
Unobtanium uses the same algorithm as bitcoin (SHA256) which also means we run on the same cutting edge ASIC technology as bitcoin. Our p2p network is global, we have nodes in every major country, the largest among them are situated in Asia and the United States. We find ourselves in a truly wonderful position to attract investors who believe in low volume “value storage”. We believe in our network. Our hashrate and difficulty suffice to back up our claims. Ultra rarity is a special characteristic as only 1 UNO per block can be obtained. Halving every 102,000 blocks, only 196,875 Proof of Work UNO will be minted before .0001 minimum block subsidies take effect at block 612,000.

## Security
We care about our products, and most importatly we care about delivering robust and secure services. Our online vault (currently in development) will feature 2-way verification, and added security layers to help protect our clients. For highest security and encryption however, we recommend using our desktop vault. Investors can rest assured that we apply a vigorous amount of our time developing added security measures and we are always looking to the future with regards to new innovations in cryptographic security technologies.

## Privacy
Investors in Unobtanium can take solace in our privacy policies. As with all crypto-currencies anonymity, and privacy are built in. We are working on new ways to take our customers’ privacy even more seriously. Bitcoin has flaws: your IP address can be logged by listening for a transaction’s relays. Currently we recommend our business customers generate a new address for every large transaction to cloak any possible associations with a single wallet ID. Always try to remember that it is your own responsibility to adopt secure practices in order to protect your privacy.

## Efficiency
250.000 UNOs is the maximum amount to ever be generated, there cannot be more. This finite resource is currently 60% mined with a total of 155.925 Unobtanium in circulation today. After our sixth block halving occurs, .0001 blocks will be produced for many years after bitcoin has been mined out. Factoring in our low volume and ultra-rarity, our “rockchain” is relatively immune to dust and bloat. These are common problems for tokens in the multi-millions and billions. A low cap on our total number produced keeps our currency more stable and efficient.

## Innovation
At Unobtanium, we believe in our products, and as CEO I believe in my team of developers. During a relatively short period of time we have managed to take an open-source project that had many divergent directions and focus the talent at our disposal on a set of core beliefs about what crypto-currency should be. We don’t refer to ourselfs as a coin, because we have innovated a new metric scale that distributes value based on weight. The core transaction protocols are still there, but we have added a new feature on top of the existing secure method for making transactions. Our web services team is pushing the boundaries of what an open-source project should be. We think of ourselves as a small and adaptive start-up, and that is why I believe investors will see us differently. We are trying new things and experimenting with great, and sometimes crazy ideas. We don’t think anyone else in crypto is on our next-level wave of thinking. We pledge never to stop pushing the limits of what can be achieved with a next generation cryptographic currency designed for the professional.
